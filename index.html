<h3 id="domain-of-interest-goals-">Domain of interest &amp; goals:</h3>
<p>Our area of choice is <strong>budgeting and expense tracking</strong>. We are paying special attention to the different methods users have to track their spending and set their saving goals. We want to understand what kind of expense tracking or budgeting solution fits <strong>most</strong> users, and why. In whatever solution we build, we want to achieve a balance that can be welcoming to most people, but that may also appeal to users with extraordinary needs. </p>
<h3 id="key-preliminary-assumptions-">Key (preliminary) assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>People with no experience with them can feel overwhelmed by large, feature-rich expense tracking and budgeting applications.</li>
<li>Users do not want to spend more time tracking their expenses than is necessary -- ironically, <strong>time is money!</strong></li>
<li>There is a middle-ground to be found between the wants of casual and extreme expense-tracker users, where the underlying motivations behind most people&#39;s <em>need</em> for budgeting guidance can be addressed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interview-planning-">Interview planning:</h3>
<p>The interviews were conducted during approximately 30 minutes, both through in-person and virtual means. When one person conducted the user interview another team member took notes. We tried to keep the exploratory character of the conversations open, and focused on the interests of the interviewee. We sought to get  an accurate picture of their motivations behind budgeting and expense tracking, and their tried and tested methods (if any).</p>
<h3 id="key-takeaways-">Key takeaways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users want a <em>simplified</em> breakdown of their financial expenses. Some may prefer detail, but others seek flexibility.</li>
<li>Users may need different insights from their expense tracking or budgeting service depending on the status of their income streams (stable v.s. unstable).</li>
<li>Extreme users may not always use aids consistently, but their unique needs should be understood to allow them to track expenses <strong>without constant commitment</strong>.</li>
<li>Some common &#39;contexts&#39; for expense tracking that cause the most concern are vacationing and food.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps-">Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Iterate on interview questions and rephrase them to more open ended ones that let us hear about the user <em>stories</em>.</li>
<li>Narrow down target users from casual and extreme users to gain a clearer understanding of the overall user profile.</li>
<li>Identify the <strong>minimum</strong> necessary information that any expense tracker needs to attract the largest number of users. Iterate on our findings.</li>
</ul>
